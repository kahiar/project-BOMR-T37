**Objectives:**

1) Have a document with the complete clear requirements for the project.

2) Have all members be clear on the organisation of the code

3) Create a Notebook which opens camera live feed (phone or webcam), detects the live position of ArUco markers, then crops the image and performs the perspective transform.

4) Test out code on white background with printed markers and obstacles

5) Define next meeting date and what is expected of each member

**Discussion points** *(to be added during or after meeting)*:

- Daniel explained the whole code structure - with classes etc...
- Daniel and Rachid will look deeper into Kalman filters
- Nicho will look into the controller
- !! Important: take into account when there is not enough space between obstacles! - if 2 extended obstacle edges intersect: make it impossible for robot to pass
- Mesurer les dimensions de l'environnement pour set le bon ratio witdth/height pour la cropped image
